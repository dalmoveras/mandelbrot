## Mandelbrot Set
Simple project to plot mandelbrot fractal using Rust.

#### About Mandelbrot Set
The Mandelbrot set is generated by iteration, which means to repeat a process over and over again. 
In mathematics this process is most often the application of a mathematical function. For the Mandelbrot set, 
the functions involved are some of the simplest imaginable: they all are what is called quadratic polynomials
and have the form `f(x) = x2 + c`, where `c` is a constant number.

The Mandelbrot set is defined as the set of complex numbers `c` for which `z` does not fly out to infinity.
